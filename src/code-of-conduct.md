# Code of Conduct

Rules for being in this webring.

LPLEASE BE AWARE THAT THIS IS ALL UNDER REVIEW!! 
Rules: 
1. All members of this webring are confessing Christians!
   a. I will NOT be judging based on denomination (unless you are Mormon or are in any otherwise similar cults that are regularly denounced -- you are thus not a Christian and are not associated with true Christianity in any way, shape, or form; meaning, you're not a 'valid' denomination.).
   b. The one ground-requirement necessary for joining is that you agree with the Nicene Creed and denounce liberal theology.
   c. In case you're not certain what liberal theology is, please message me and we can talk it out! I myself don't know if that label completely holds to everything I'm thinking of, but things like "God doesn't denounce homosexuality" is a major aspect of liberal theology present within many churches and individuals and is outright heresy. 
3. Please be polite! I don't know quite how webrings work yet, but any interaction between members should be in good faith. :))
4. Any kind of blogs are welcome! Just so long as you're a clear professing Christian on your blog, and hold to the rules above, you're good to go! :))
